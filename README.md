## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This project is a game that lets players discover a post-apocalyptic world through the eyes of a survivor. The aim of the game is to get out of the city while surviving the various obstacles that stand in the survivor's way (monsters, etc.).
## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development.

### Prerequisites

To install this project, you need to have the following software installed on your machine:

```
Install Javafx 21LTS
```

### Installing

Firts, download the repository:

```
https://github.com/c0opycat/projet_poo2
```

Then, you can unzip the file.<br>

## üî® Compilation <a name = "compilation"></a>

To compile the project, you need to have JavaFX installed on your machine.<br>
You can download it from the [JavaFX website](https://www.azul.com/).<br>

Then you can go to the main folder of the project and run the following command:

```
./compile.sh
```
If you have a local JavaFX installation, you need to modify the compile.sh file to add the path of your JavaFX installation.<br>
To do this:<br>
 - Open the main folder.<br>
 - Edit the file "compile.sh" to add the path of your JavaFX installation.<br>
 - Replace the line with a comment : #replace this line with the path to your javafx compiler<br>

```
javac -d "${BIN_DIR}" -cp "${LIB_DIR}/json-20250107.jar" @tempo
```

To

```
[your/path/to/javafx]/javac -d "${BIN_DIR}" -cp "${LIB_DIR}/json-20250107.jar" @tempo
```

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

After the compilation, you can run the game with the script "run.sh".<br>
To do this, you need to go to the main folder and run the following command:

```
./run.sh
```

Same as for compilation, if you have a local JavaFX installation, you need to modify the run.sh file to add the path of your JavaFX installation.<br>
To do this:<br>
 - Open the main folder.<br>
 - Edit the file "run.sh" to add the path of your JavaFX installation.<br>
 - Replace the line with a comment : #replace this line with the path to your javafx executor<br>

```
java -cp "${BIN_DIR}:${LIB_DIR}/json-20250107.jar" "${MAIN_CLASS}"
```
TO

```
[your/path/to/javafx]/java -cp "${BIN_DIR}:${LIB_DIR}/json-20250107.jar" "${MAIN_CLASS}"
```
